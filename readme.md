# Profiler Insight

## Overview

Profiler Insight is an tool that helps data stewards and data analysts gain easy insights into the quality of their data. Through data profiling, users can assess data quality, prioritize cleansing actions, and perform impact analyses. Improving data quality at the source leads to better data throughout all operational processes, ultimately resulting in lower operational costs and more efficient workflows.

## Why Profiler Insight?

Current data profiling tools often provide only superficial insights and typically focus on evaluating data quality at the end of the data lifecycle. Profiler Insight offers deeper and more actionable information from the beginning of the data lifecycle, allowing issues to be addressed and resolved at the source.
